**What is a RetroTINK? Or a VGA666?**

[RetroTINK](http://www.retrotink.com) is a GPIO hat for the Raspberry Pi3/3B+ that converts digital video signal back into 24-bit analog. It provides output over RCA, S-Video, Component, and VGA -- as well as supporting CSYNC, super-resolutions, and custom resolution timings. 

[VGA666](https://github.com/PiSupply/Gert-VGA-666) is a GPIO hat for the Raspberry Pi that converts digital video signal back into an 18-bit analog out via VGA. It also allows for super-resolutions and custom resolution timings.

[Pi2SCART](http://pi2jamma.info/pi2scart) is a GPIO hat for the Raspberry Pi that converts digital video signal back into an 18-bit analog RGB out via SCART. It also allows for super-resolutions and custom resolution timings.

___

**What Does That Even Mean?**

It makes your Pi capable of outputting a true 240p analog signal for CRT televisions and monitors, and is capable of 5x (1600x240) and higher super resolutions.

___

**What Does That Look Like?**

I don't have the greatest pics saved for comparison, but [here's](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNjCNQs45Gza9YDe-WWCmIQZWPUEbVvt8PoIdKRNrBiEPedw-yl6r5g8jKpWkfJWA?key=QWtsS3FBWWo0aHU5M1hlRDVvU3JxQVNsSVoxSVdB) some examples of the 888.

**What is Run-Ahead?**

> [The Run Ahead feature calculates the frames as fast as possible in the background to "rollback" the action as close as possible to the input command requested.](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/)

I've enabled run-ahead on most of the 8 & 16-bit consoles and handhelds. A single frame (and using the second instance) is saved here, which dramatically improves input lag without affecting performance on a Pi3B. More frames would require more hardware power, and may be achievable via overclocking.

    lr-snes9x2010 consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-fceumm consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-beetle-pce-fast consistent 60.1-60.2 @ 60.000000hz

    lr-genesis-gx-plus consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (both genesis and sega cd)

    lr-picodrive consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (master system, game gear, and 32X)

    lr-gambatte consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz (SGB2 framerate)

    lr-mgba consistent 59.8-60.4 FPS @ 60.002220hz (Gamecube framerate)


To disable runahead for a game (or emulator):

**What about your new Per-Game Configs and Snap-Shader?**

The RGB and VGA forks are now utilizing Snap-Shader, plus a newly-enhanced runcommand-onstart script, with provision for *user-specified per-game configuration*! 

*Here's the new script:*

    https://github.com/crtpi/CRTPi-Project/blob/master/RGB-to_opt/retropie/configs/all/runcommand-onstart.sh

*Here's information about Snap-Shader:*

    https://github.com/ektgit/snap-shader-240p

*And here's a quick rundown on how it works:*

Not only does the new script carry forward the per-core scripting for 2048x / 1920x / and 1600x resolutions -- but adds per-game scripting by adding a text file to the system config and naming the rom(s) within the file. This allows you to force 2048x on a system that defaults to 1920x, and vise versa. This is especially useful for PSX, FDS, PCE/PCE-CD, and MAME for the few games that are 256 or 512 wide. Below are some example config files:

**/opt/retropie/conifgs/psx/256.txt**

    Brave Prove
    Castlevania - Symphony of the Night
    Crash Bandicoot
    Final Fantasy Origins
    Final Fantasy Tactics

**/opt/retropie/conifgs/megadrive/256.txt**

    Bubble And Squeak
    Bubsy in - Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind 
    Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble 
    Caesars Palace 
    Captain America and the Avengers 

**/opt/retropie/conifgs/virtualboy/320.txt**

    all

You get the jist. It doesn't need an extension, not case sensitive, but should match the ROM name (including punctuation) exactly. This forces them to launch in 2048x240p instead of the default 1920x240p, or the other way round. This gives the end user full control on a game-per-game basis over the horizontal integer. You'll still need to write a retroarch game config to override the defaults there, but this at least gets you the right field. For games with odd/shifting vertical resolutions (like Chrono Cross, Battle Arena Toshinden, Castlevania SotN, etc.), a single pass of snap-shader is applied (snap-basic, nearest neighbor filtering, and "don't care" scale).
___


**What Does This NOT Have?**

This doesn't have any ROMs (other than freeware test suites), BIOS files, music, screenshots, metadata, or videos concerning copy-written games. Other than the configurations and overlays, it has nothing that can't be downloaded through the repository or freeware.

**I have X Issue! Help?**

***I only have like 500mb of free space on my XXgb SD card!***

You need to expand your file system via Raspi-Config. Follow [these](https://crispconcept.com/pages/expand-sd-card) steps. 

***Samba Share won't work after I set up Wi-Fi!***

Samba share service starts on boot, pending that a network is available. Configure your Wi-Fi then reboot first, and if that doesn't fix it then go into Retropie Setup > Configuration/Tools > Samba > Install Samba.  Once it's complete, reboot and it should be golden.

***USB-Romservice and/or Retropie-Mount don't work!***

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive), but follow these steps before plugging in your thumb drive:

* Go to Retropie-Setup
* Update retropie install script
* Go to Manage Packages -> Optional Packages
* Scroll all the way down to usbromservice
* Uninstall usbromservice
* Install it again from Binary
* Once finished, choose Configuration, then Enable USB Romservice
* Reboot, and wait for it to fully boot in to ES
* Plug in USB stick (has to be FAT32) and WAIT A LONG TIME (if your stick has a light, wait for it to stop flashing)
