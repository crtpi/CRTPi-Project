As some of you may have seen, amongst other errors -- there was an issue with this image's runcommand-onstart scripting that was forcing 2048x240p to all libretro emulators. The fix in question will be at the bottom of this post. I've redumped the CRTPi-RGB v.30 image. The link hasn't changed, but the checksum has.

**Changelog: v3.0 for 888 & 666 05/12/2020 - Emergency Fixes**

* Fixed runcommand-onstart.sh and runcommand-onstart.666 files so resolution no longer forces into 2048 on every system.
* Restored functionality to force 1920 via 320.txt and 2048 via 256.txt in '/opt/retropie/configs/$system/'
* Restored functionality to the VGA666 and Retrotink enable scripts.
* Restored PCE-CD system, as Retropie doesn't generate a default emulators.cfg and retroarch.cfg.
* Readded CaveStory game files to /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ports/CaveStory/ so it plays out of the box. 
* Redumped and uploaded image, new MD5: d9d28f5ae8fe5cc829348be4b5a103fc
* New Retrotink/VGA666 icons in Retropie Menu
* Various tweaks and tricks

**What's the fix if I already installed it?!**

*IF YOU INSTALLED THIS IMAGE OR DOWNLOADED THE CRTPi-RGB.zip or CRTPi-VGA.zip PACKAGE(S) FROM THE GITHUB BEFORE 15:30PST ON 5/11/20, PLEASE READ!!!*

If you have already flashed the CRTPi-RGB image from my Google drive, or installed the configs from my Github, there is a *major* issue with the runcommand-onstart.sh script. Long story short, the script I modified that looks for 240.txt and 320.txt breaks the entire chain and forces 2048x240p for ALL libretro emulators. Needless to say, this is a problem, and super embarassing for me. :( Please follow the instructions below.
