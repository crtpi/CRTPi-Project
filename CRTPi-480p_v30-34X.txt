**What is this?**

I finally did something for people who don't want to use expensive video hats and SDTV's! This image boots in your choise of CEA 480p or various 640x480p VGA modes. Using Snap-Shader and Simple-Bilinear-Scanlines, I've given a way to upscale 240p content to 480p, while still looking and performing console-fresh! The perfect image for EDTV, HiScan sets, mulit-scan monitors, GSB arcade boards -- this even works on HDTV's that don't upscale 480p content!! 

***That said, I hate it and it should burn in hell... Enjoy!***

**What Does That Look Like?**

[Here's a bunch of pics I took, some better than others!](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipP4Z6IIXXET_YCU-ZEYAvzzln7zzRe5ETdCzfM8HOOelZKq01QoABlysxcNydTIGg?key=OXVZU2RZMW02ZEtNX08td216VlZhTU9RVHlYNkZn)

**What is Different?**

**What is Run-Ahead?**

> [The Run Ahead feature calculates the frames as fast as possible in the background to "rollback" the action as close as possible to the input command requested.](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/)

I've enabled run-ahead on most of the 8 & 16-bit consoles and handhelds. A single frame (and using the second instance) is saved here, which dramatically improves input lag without affecting performance on a Pi3B+. More frames would require more hardware power, and may be achievable via overclocking.

    lr-snes9x2010 consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-fceumm consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz 

    lr-beetle-pce-fast consistent 60.1-60.2 @ 60.000000hz

    lr-genesis-gx-plus consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (both genesis and sega cd)

    lr-picodrive consistent 59.9-60.2 FPS @ 59.922741hz (master system, game gear, and 32X)

    lr-gambatte consistent 60.0-60.2 FPS @ 60.098801hz (SGB2 framerate)

    lr-mgba consistent 59.8-60.4 FPS @ 60.002220hz (Gamecube framerate)


To disable runahead for a game (or emulator):

    Quick Menu > Latency > Run-Ahead to Reduce Latency > OFF

**What is Snap-Shader?**

It's a Retroarch GSL shader that ensures games on CRT will look as good as on original hardware. It Makes games crisp vertically, and not shimmer horizontally. It correctly aligns the games for you regardless of console. Virtually eliminates the need for separate configurations per core (console).

https://github.com/ektgit/snap-shader-240p

Snap Shader (especially the snap-basic) is super useful on consoles where you may have a mix of horizontal resolutions within the core that you don't necessarily want to set individual game configs for, which for this build, is basically everything but Megadrive, GBA, GBC, Doom, and Quake.

___

**What Does This NOT Have?**

This doesn't have any ROMs (other than freeware test suites), BIOS files, music, screenshots, metadata, or videos concerning copy-written games. Other than the configurations and overlays, it has nothing that can't be downloaded through the repository or freeware.

___

**Where Can I Get It?**

You can download a premade image from Google Drive:

> NOTE: Please expand your file system via Raspi-Config after your first boot, and reboot!

**How do I set this up?**

Edit the /boot/config.txt before first boot.

If you're using an HDMI to <blank> converter, select *one* HDMI block of your preference by uncommenting it and commenting out the rest. The default is HDMI CEA 480p.

If you're using a VGA666, uncomment this block, and then *one* VGA666 block of your choice.

    \## VGA666 - DPI Settings
    \#dtoverlay=vga666
    \#enable_dpi_lcd=1
    \#display_default_lcd=1

**The GBA/GBC/GB overlay is cropped on my <INSTERT OUTPUT METHOD HERE>!!!**

Go into the Retroarch menu in game and navigate to "Quick Menu > On-Screen Overlay".  Click "Overlay Preset" and choose the VGA version instead of the 480p version -- "crt_gbaplayer..." is for GBA and "crt_supergameboy..." is for GB/GBC.

**I have X Issue! Help?**

***Chrono Cross (or Bloody Roar II) or some other PSX game has weird thick-as-fuck scanlines!***

Disable the scanline shader, leaving Snap-Basic in place. Chances are you're playing a 480i game that wasn't intended to have scanlines, and the shader can't clamp to the right frames.

***I only have like 500mb of free space on my XXgb SD card!***

You need to expand your file system via Raspi-Config. Follow [these](https://crispconcept.com/pages/expand-sd-card) steps. 

***GBA, PSX, Neo-Geo, Sega-CD, PCE-CD, etc. games don't work!***

I haven't included any bios's that didn't come with the retropie stock image, so you'll need to install the appropriate files in the BIOS folder.  For Neo-Geo, I highly recommend the UniBios (renamed to neogeo.zip).

***Samba Share won't work after I set up Wi-Fi!***

Samba share service starts on boot, pending that a network is available. Configure your Wi-Fi then reboot first, and if that doesn't fix it then go into Retropie Setup > Configuration/Tools > Samba > Install Samba.  Once it's complete, reboot and it should be golden.

***USB-Romservice and/or Retropie-Mount don't work!***

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive), but follow these steps before plugging in your thumb drive:

* Go to Retropie-Setup
* Update retropie install script
* Go to Manage Packages -> Optional Packages
* Scroll all the way down to usbromservice
* Uninstall usbromservice
* Install it again from Binary
* Once finished, choose Configuration, then Enable USB Romservice
* Reboot, and wait for it to fully boot in to ES
* Plug in USB stick (has to be FAT32) and WAIT A LONG TIME (if your stick has a light, wait for it to stop flashing)
